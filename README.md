# nixless
a horribly writen suckless styled nix thing (kinda a joke obv). this is very exsperimental btw and may not work. how to use it:
```
1. config the config.c file
2. run sudo (or doas) nixless
3. if you did it right then it should install
```
---
to install (might not work):
```
cd nixless/nixless-src
make install
```
if you have losts of confidence in my stuff then do 
```
make bin
```
